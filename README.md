My Active Directory notes

## Introduction of Active Directory
Active Directory is a Microsoft service that provides centralized authentication and authorization to network resources. It’s used in business environments to simplify user management, control access to data, and enforce company security policies.

how it works:
1) Authentication: Active Directory verifies a user’s credentials (username and password). The user’s credentials are stored in the Active Directory database.
2) Authorization: This process grants or denies a user to do something such as edit a file or access an application.

Active Directory is especially useful for companies that have to manage lots of endpoints and servers. It stores information about objects on the network and makes this information easy for administrators and users to find and use. Objects might include user accounts, computer accounts, and resources like file and print servers.

Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) is the main component of Active Directory. It’s the Server Role in Windows Server that you install if you want to promote the server to a domain controller (DC). DCs host a copy of the AD database and they perform authentication and authorization functions to make resources and data available to network users and administrators.

Active Directory is for almost any company or organization out there. It simplifies life for administrators and end users while enhancing security for organizations. Administrators and end users share the centralized user and rights management, as well as centralized control over computer and user configurations through the AD Group Policy feature.
